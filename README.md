# Holistic Detection with Python

In this Project Holistic Detection, it detect Left and Right Hand, Face Mesh,
and Pose Detection using Libraries Opencv and Mediapipe in Python.


##  System Information
An OpenCV Python Holistic Detection We are going to detect left and right hand, face mesh, and pose detection. MediaPipe has a lot of built-in customizable Machine Learning Solutions. MediaPipe is the newest and fastest within machine learning solutions and can be run on common hardware which we are going to see throughout this article.

### What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time images and videos while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks.

### What is MediaPipe?

MediaPipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video, audio, etc. This cross-platform Framework works in Desktop/Server, Android, iOS, and embedded devices like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. 

### What is MediaPipe Holistic?

MediaPipe Holistic utilizes the pose, face and hand landmark models in MediaPipe Pose, MediaPipe Face Mesh and MediaPipe Hands respectively to generate a total of 543 landmarks (33 pose landmarks, 468 face landmarks, and 21 hand landmarks per hand).

## To start executing Holistic Detection OpenCV Python
### Make sure that you have
1. Installed Python 3.10  and PyCharm on your computer.
2. Install Mediapipe and setup Mediapipe Holistic for Python.
3. Access a real time video feed from your webcam using OpenCV.
4. Detect and visualise facial landmarks, body poses and hand poses.
